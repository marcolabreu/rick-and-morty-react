# Rick and Morty React

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org) app to visualize characters from Rick & Morty TV show. The project was bootstrapped with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), a React static generator framework, for easy deployment on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Now](https://zeit.co/now). Both can automatically build and deploy NextJS sites. Data will be obtained from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com).

The initial requirements were very simple:
* display the characters with pagination;
* be able to filter by status, species and gender;
* be able to search a character by name;
* be able to sort the cards by name (ascendant and descendant).

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
